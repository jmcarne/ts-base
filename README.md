Building a PoC Automatization Ansible in ITNow to be used by Ts-Base.
-------------------------------------------

These playbooks require Ansible 1.2.

These playbooks are meant to be a reference and starter's guide to building
Ansible Playbooks. These playbooks were tested on RHEL 7.x so we recommend
that you use RHEL to test these modules.

This LAMP stack can be on a single node or multiple nodes. The inventory file
'hosts' defines the nodes in which the stacks should be configured.

        [webservers]
        localhost

        [dbservers]
        bensible

Here the webserver would be configured on the local host and the dbserver on a
server called "bensible". The stack can be deployed using the following
command:

        ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml

Once done, you can check the results by browsing to http://localhost/index.php.
You should see a simple test page and a list of databases retrieved from the
database server.

repository where exists different folder depending on the ts-base team

Each folder contains all the Playbooks generated by the team

There is a yml file which contains all the variables used in the execution of its associated Playbook
